# Crypto Send and receive React web3.O application


Cryptonite is a cryptocurrency application utilizing the MERN stack and blockchain technology written in JavaScript. React is powering the front end views with Express routing our backend to appwrite. There are also several npm packages we employed to deliver the features of our MVP. Below we'll discuss certain features and why we made the decisions we did in our application.



## Programming language used
- HTML
- CSS
- Java script
- React 
- Taliwind css
- Solidity

## How to work
A work in connecat your metamask walleat and send and receive  
your crypto and easy to work and faster.
## What’s Included?
Your environment will have everything you need to build a modern single-page React app:
- React, JSX, ES6, Solidity and Flow syntax support.
- Language extras beyond ES6 like the object spread operator.
- Autoprefixed CSS, so you don’t need -webkit- or other prefixes.
- A fast interactive unit test runner with built-in support for coverage reporting.
- A live development server that warns about common mistakes.
- A build script to bundle JS, CSS, and images for production, with hashes and sourcemaps.
- An offline-first service worker and a web app manifest, meeting all the Progressive Web App criteria. (Note: Using the service worker is opt-in as of react-scripts@2.0.0 and higher)
Hassle-free updates for the above tools with a single dependency.
Check out this guide for an overview of how these tools fit together.

The tradeoff is that these tools are preconfigured to work in a specific way. If your project needs more customization, you can "eject" and customize it, but then you will need to maintain this configuration.
## Future 
- Reliability
- Security
- Low Fees
- React Base
- Blockchain
